# Exercises

The main exercise for this session is to check that you can login to the JupyterHub server, launch a Notebook, and execute code and Markdown cells.

## Exercise 1

Login to the JupyterHub server. Create a new Notebook (rename this to something sensible). Then launch the User Interface Tour.

## Exercise 2 - Hello World

In the tradition of nearly every introductory programming tutorial, you are going to make the computer print &ldquo;Hello world&rdquo;. When entering code from the Course Book into your Notebooks, we strongly recommend that you _type_ the code out, and do not just copy and paste. Typing the code will give your brain long enough to register what you are actually doing, and has the side benefit that you will make at least a few mistakes that you can then practice fixing.

You should have a pristine Notebook from completing Exercise 1. The first cell will be a code cell. Type the following into your code cell and run the cell using âŒ˜+`Enter`, or clicking the `Run` Toolbar button.
```python
print("Hello world")
```
