# Getting started with Jupyter Notebooks

When you first log on to the [JupyterHub server](./how_to_access_the_jupyterhub_server.md) you should see a screen like this:

This is the **Notebook Dashboard**, which allows you to access and manage your Jupyter Notebooks. The Dashboard allows you to create, open, rename, move, and delete Notebooks.

If you have just logged onto the JupyterHub server for the first time, You should have two items already listed in your Dashboard:
- A folder named `courses`.
- A Notebook named `Welcome.ipynb`.
The `.ipynb` file extension indicates that `Welcome.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook.

Clicking on `Welcome.ipynb` should open a new tab with the **Welcome Notebook** running inside it.

There is not much to see or do in this Notebook, but if you can open it up then you know that you have connected properly to the Jupyterhub Server and are able to run Notebooks.

The **Welcome Notebook** contains links to a set of other Notebooks; one for each course that will be using the Chemistry JupyterHub server for running Python. You will see a dedicated **CH40208 Notebook**:
