# Exercise 1

In this exercise, you will write sopme code to convert some user input from Fahrenheit to Celcius. 
For reference, the equation for this is, 

$$ T(^\circ\text{C}) = \frac{5 [T(^\circ\text{F}) - 32]}{9}.$$ 

Once you have calculated the value, print it!

We have structured this notebook to help your understanding of how the problem is broken down.

First, we define the Fahrenheit temperature that we want to convert as a float variable.

# define the Fahrenheit value



Write a cell that performed the arithmetic, and defines the result of the calculation as a new variable.

# do the arithmatic



With the calculation performed, the only step left is to print the result. 

# print the result



Now try writing similar code that converts from Kelvin to Fahrenheit (you will need to do some algebra to get the right equation).
