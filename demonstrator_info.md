If you are not aware all of the material lives on GitHub (https://github.com/pythoninchemistry/ch40208), however, be warned that typically material is not fully baked until the Monday before the demonstrating on the Wednesday; I welcome comments at any time but be aware it might be a waste of time before the Monday as that section might get deleted. It would be great (not mandatory or expected) if you can have a look at the stuff before Wednesday morning - if for no other reason than to point out when I am explaining things badly.

The other thing worth mentioning (that I mentioned in person to Adam, Jacob, and Alex before week 1) is with respect to our expectations of you as demonstrators:

- if a student is struggling and you don’t think you can help: ask us

- never ever drive (use the keyboard). if you feel the urge to type stop yourself (my preference is to tell the students that I physically cannot touch their keyboard), cause if I see you doing it I will ask you to sit outside like the naughty child you have been

- don’t give the students the answers, make them work for it! Help them work it out for themselves, this will (1) improve their learning (2) improve their learning experience (these points are also relevant to the point above). Ask us if you can’t see a clear method for this

- if a student is being “stroppy” (this should never happen cause they are adults) and you can’t be arsed with them, let Ben or I know

- if a student misses a week, make the student aware that everything they need is in the handout, if they are unsatisfied try your best to go through the previous weeks material with them (or ask Ben or I to do so), if they still aren’t happy suggest they take advantage of my “office hours” (2-5 Wednesday in the 1S pool)
