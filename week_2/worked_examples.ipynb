    "It is important to note that those represent only an example of how the problem in the handout may be approached. \n",
    "Programming problems such as these have **many** correct methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We **strongly** advise that you try and work though the problem without looking at this worked example. \n",
    "This is the best way to improve your programming skills; as programming is inherently problem-solving based. \n",

    "## Problem 1: Interatomic distances\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spec \n",
    "\n",
    "Write some code that can read in the `molecule1.txt` or `molecule2.txt` files available from Moodle and evaluate the distances between each pair of atoms in the molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import `numpy` and `sqrt`\n",
    "2. Read the x, y, and z coordinates in using `np.loadtxt`\n",
    "3. Loop through each **pair** of atoms (this will require a double *nested* loop)\n",
    "4. For each pair, calculate the distance\n",
    "5. Print the distance between the pair of atoms"
